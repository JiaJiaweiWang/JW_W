Code for calculations in the article 'Thermalization of Quantum Many-Body Scars in Kinetically Constrained Systems'.
Containing several Python codes saved as '.py', where we have used the package 'qutip' in those calculations.
Also containing several codes from matlab.
We have renamed these codes in accordance with the figures from our manuscript.
The matlab function 'eigsub.m' is a very simple tools we built in order to diagnalize the Hamiltonian within a single symmetry sectors.
